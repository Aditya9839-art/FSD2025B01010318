<header><h1>Bihar Elections Heat Up as Jan Suraj Party Gains Ground</h1>
<h2>Date: October 24, 2025
Location: Patna, Bihar
</h2></header>
<main><section><P><i>With Bihar’s state elections just weeks away, the political landscape is shifting rapidly. A tight three-way contest is emerging between the incumbent NDA, the INDIA Alliance, and the rising Jan Suraj Party led by political strategist Prashant Kishor. Recent polls suggest the traditional parties are facing stiff competition from Kishor’s grassroots campaign, which has gained traction among younger voters and rural communities.
Key Developments:
<br>- 🗳️<b> <b>JMM Opts Out:</b>
 The Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) announced it will not contest the Bihar elections, citing a “political conspiracy” by allies RJD and Congress.
<br>- 💰<b> Populist Push:</b><br>

</b> Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently transferred ₹10,000 each to 7.5 million women in Bihar, part of a broader self-employment and skill-building initiative aimed at boosting support in the state.
<br>- 🌾 <b>Economic Focus:</b>
The central government also announced investments in Bihar’s fox-nut (makhana) value chain, signaling a strategic focus on local industries.
What’s Next:
As campaigning intensifies, all eyes are on how the Jan Suraj Party will reshape the electoral dynamics. With populist measures and strategic alliances in play, Bihar could see one of its most unpredictable elections in recent history.
